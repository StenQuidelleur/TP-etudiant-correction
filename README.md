# Lite MVC

## Description

This repository is a lite PHP MVC structure from scratch.

For this one, just a simple example where users can choose one of their databases and see tables in it.

## Steps

1. Clone the repo from Github.
2. Run `composer install`.
3. Create _config/db.php_ from _config/db.php.dist_ file and add your DB parameters. Don't delete the _.dist_ file, it must be kept.

```php
define('APP_DB_HOST', 'your_db_host');
define('APP_DB_NAME', 'your_db_name');
define('APP_DB_USER', 'your_db_user_wich_is_not_root');
define('APP_DB_PASSWORD', 'your_db_password');
```

4. To load the database, uncomment the line 16 of config.php, reload homepage and comment again the line.
5. Run the internal PHP webserver with `php -S localhost:8000 -t public/`. The option `-t` with `public` as parameter means your localhost will target the `/public` folder.
6. Go to `localhost:8000` with your favorite browser.
7. From this starter kit, create your own web application.
